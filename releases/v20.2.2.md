~~~

### Security updates

- CockroachDB no longer reports the use of expired or invalid web auth cookies in the log file by default. [#55298][#55298]
- Updated the state validation for the OIDC login flow and replaced it with a stateless hash validation of the state parameter with the browser cookie using HMAC. [#56502][#56502]

### Enterprise edition changes

- The `insecure_tls_skip_verify` query param may now be set on [changefeed](../v20.2/stream-data-out-of-cockroachdb-using-changefeeds.html) sinks. This disables client-side validation of responses and should be avoided if possible since it creates man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities unless combined with another method of authentication. [#56338][#56338]

### SQL language changes

- Updated the `TransactionRetryWithProtoRefreshError` to include a `HINT` field that links to [a web page containing useful information to resolve the error](../v20.2/transaction-retry-error-reference.html#transactionretrywithprotorefresherror). [#56049][#56049]
- Parsing intervals with fractional years now produces intervals with no more precision than months, to match the behavior of Postgres. [#56158][#56158]
- The `pg_attribute.atttypmod` column in the `pg_catalog` is now populated for [collated string types](../v20.2/collate.html). This also populates the value of the `TypeModifier` in the `RowDescription` message of the [pgwire protocol](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/protocol.html). [#55154][#55154]
- Add an option to [scheduled backups](../v20.2/manage-a-backup-schedule.html) to maintain a timeseries metric for last backed up timestamp. [#54987][#54987]
- Added an [`owner`](../v20.2/owner-to.html) column to the following statements: [`SHOW DATABASES`](../v20.2/show-databases.html), [`SHOW ENUMS`](../v20.2/show-enums.html),[`SHOW TABLES`](../v20.2/show-tables.html), and [`SHOW SCHEMAS`](../v20.2/show-schemas.html). [#56325][#56325]

### API endpoint changes

- `AWS_SERVER_ENC_MODE` and `AWS_SERVER_KMS_ID` can now be specified as a param in all s3 URIs which write to the store. (e.g.: Changefeed, BACKUP) [#56132][#56132]

### Bug fixes

- CockroachDB could previously crash when executing a query via the vectorized engine when most of the SQL memory (determined via `--max-sql-memory` startup argument) has already been reserved. This is now fixed. [#55457][#55457]
- Fixed possible write skew in distributed queries that have both zigzag joins and table readers with the zigzag joins reading keys not read by the table readers. Note that although this sounds scary, the bug itself is very rare. [#55563][#55563]
- The current implementation of changefeeds is incompatible with the vectorized engine, so whenever the latter is being used to run the former, it could hang indefinitely. This is now fixed. Namely, on 20.2 releases this could happen if the user runs `SET vectorize_row_count_threshold=0;`, and on 20.1 releases - if the user runs `SET vectorize=on`. [#55753][#55753]
- CockroachDB previously could incorrectly evaluate sqrdiff function when used as a window function in some cases, and now it is fixed. [#55995][#55995]
- CockroachDB could previously incorrectly compute some aggregate functions with DISTINCT clauses when the query projects other columns/functions and the vectorized engine was used. This bug was introduced in 20.2.0.alpha.3 release. [#55872][#55872]
- CockroachDB previously could return incorrect results in rare circumstances when computing the aggregation functions when some of the functions have DISTINCT clause and some don't (the latter might not see all the necessary data), and this is now fixed. This bug has been present for several years. [#55872][#55872]
- Previously, the JSON fetch value operator, `->`, would evaluate incorrectly in some cases. This has been fixed. [#55447][#55447]
- Scheduled BACKUP now supports KMS encryption. [#56099][#56099]
- Fix a bug where IMPORTs of malformed Avro records could hang forever. [#56094][#56094]
- Avoid crashing when BACKUP is unable to count the total nodes in the cluster. [#56050][#56050]
- Fixed a bug where a IMPORTING a PGDUMP with INSERTs not targeting all columns in the database would panic. [#56034][#56034]
- Using the min/max aggregates in a prepared statement will now report the correct data type size. [#55622][#55622]
- Fixed "top-level relational expression cannot have outer columns" error in some queries that involve WITH. [#56084][#56084]
- Fixed an internal error that could occur during query planning when the use_spheroid parameter was used in the ST_Distance function as part of a filter predicate. For example, `SELECT ... WHERE ST_Distance(geog1, geog2, false) < 10` previously caused an error. This has now been fixed. [#55852][#55852]
- CockroachDB previously didn't account for all the memory used by the vectorized hash aggregation which could lead to an OOM crash. [#55555][#55555]
- Fixed a bug which allowed statements after a schema change to fail to observe side-effects of that change on referenced tables. [#56327][#56327]
- Previously if a cluster backup that was taken during a schema change, a cluster restore of that backup would create duplicates of the ongoing schema changes. [#56390][#56390]
- Previously, dumps of tables with a BIT type column would result in an error. This column type is now supported. [#56391][#56391]
- Fixed a bug which would cause transactions which modified roles and then either attempted to read or modify other roles would encounter blocking and stale data. [#55392][#55392]
- Fixed bug which did not respect disabling protected timestamp settings with zero values. [#56453][#56453]
- Fixed a panic that could occur when running `SHOW STATISTICS USING JSON` for a table in which at least one of the columns contained all null values. [#56516][#56516]
- A hypothesized bug that could allow a follower read to miss data on a range in the middle of being merged away into its left-hand neighbor was fixed. The bug seems exceedingly unlikely to have materialized in practice. [#55691][#55691]
- Fixes a bug when the Pebble storage engine is used with encryption-at-rest that could result in data corruption in some fairly rare cases after a table drop, table truncate, or replica deletion. [#56678][#56678]

### Performance improvements

- Adjusted the cost model in the optimizer so that the optimizer is less likely to plan a lookup join into a virtual table. Performing a lookup join into a virtual table is expensive, so this change will generally result in better performance for queries involving joins with virtual tables. [#56349][#56349]

### Miscellaneous

#### DB Console changes

- Diagnostics column (on statements table) has been changed and includes `Activate` button and dropdown list to download completed reports. Also diagnostics badge status is changed from `WAITING FOR QUERY` to `WAITING`. [#55890][#55890]
- Fixes issue when StatementDetails page doesn't scroll on top (when navigating from statements page) [#55433][#55433]
- Loading table-level stats requires a button click per-database in order to prevent contention for clusters with many databases and/or tables. In addition, the loading of table data is staggered by table instead of triggered simultaneously for all tables. [#55777][#55777]
- Added new cluster setting called `server.oidc_authentication.autologin` which enables automatic redirect to the OIDC login flow instead of showing password login prompt. A query param can force disable this feature in the browser by appending `?oidc_auto_login=false` to the login path. [#56510][#56510]
- Adjusted styles for Session details page [#55889][#55889]
- Transaction statistics are no longer recorded if the `sql.metrics.statement_details.threshold` cluster setting has been enabled. [#56380][#56380]

#### Admin-ui-change

- Fix link colors for "Back" link on Details pages (Node Overview, Jobs, Sessions, and statements details pages. [#55889][#55889]

#### Changes without release note annotation

- [#56638][#56638] [3350271e1][3350271e1] release-20.2: kv: remove assertion around QuotaPool and Raft window size config (Nathan VanBenschoten <nvanbenschoten@gmail.com>)
